# ShittyObfuscator
Please not that as of now this obfuscator should not be used in any serious way!
If you wan't me to continue this series and add more features, make it more secure, do tell me in the comments and I would be happy to do so!

Credits to the awesome people who made the "lua-lexer" and the "inspect.lua" file. I would make my own lexer but if I did this video would be hours long so again credit to them!
